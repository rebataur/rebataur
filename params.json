{"name":"Rebataur","tagline":"Simply use SQL to create and use Data Science infrastructure","body":"### Welcome to Rebataur.\r\nRebataur is an open source project that provides SQL abstraction to big data science projects and infrastructure and internet services locally or in the cloud.\r\n\r\n### What is the problem with Data Science now.\r\nToday there are many meritorious open source projects, such as Hadoop, Spark, Pandas, R , Python and many others that can be used for data science projects. All of these programming languages or infrastructure have their strengths and limitations. For example Hadoop is highly scalable and parallel but slightly slower then Spark. Python and R language have good statistical packages but sometimes one is easier to use than others, or performance of one is better than the other.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes Data Science a polyglot project where you combine technologies and pipeline your data through them to achieve a sophisticated analysis of data. This again has to be repeatable and maintainable.\r\n\r\nBut this polyglot environment creates a challenge of installing, learning and maintaining programs in different programming languages and platforms, and combining them repeatedly to produce the desired results in analytics. Any slight change would require multiple changes to infrastructure and programs, which will certainly cause delays and headaches over a period of time.\r\n\r\n### How does Rebataur solves this.\r\nWe already know how powerful SQL is in managing data, and all big data platforms including Hadoop and Spark are moving in this direction.\r\n\r\nImagine you could write a SQL query that would abstract away the creation of different infrastructure like Hadoop/Spark/Rlang etc, and do it on demand or on schedule, pipeline and make them apply their algorithm on them and finally output the results as a standard SQL query result.\r\n\r\nRebataur project is trying to create a single SQL interface to all data science platform and programming languages, so that you could just issue SQL statements and infrastructure and data pipeline would be created for you, and you would get the results without installing, maintaining or scaling these individual infrastructure in you data center or cloud.\r\n\r\nYou would be also be able to write plugins in case Rebataur lacks certain functionality that is critical to you.\r\n\r\nRebataur would also be able to connect to cloud services like AWS for certain analysis and retrieve data from social sites like twitter by just using plain simple SQL. \r\n\r\n\r\nAttribution : Postgresql , Multicorn, Python, Hadoop, Hive, CSVKIT, pyhs2\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more info please email on - info at rebataur dot com\r\n","google":"UA-65579198-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
