{"name":"Rebataur","tagline":"Data Science made simple : Use SQL to create and use Data Science infrastructure","body":"### Welcome to Rebataur.\r\nRebataur is an open source project that provides SQL abstraction to big data science projects and infrastructure and internet services locally or in the cloud.\r\n\r\n### What is the problem with Data Science now.\r\nToday there are many meritorious open source projects, such as Hadoop, Spark, Pandas, R , Python and many others that can be used for data science projects. All of these programming languages or infrastructure have their strengths and limitations. For example Hadoop is highly scalable and parallel but slightly slower then Spark. Python and R language have good statistical packages but sometimes one is easier to use than others, or performance of one is better than the other.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes Data Science a polyglot project where you have to combine technologies and pipeline your data through them to achieve a sophisticated analysis of data. This again has to be repeatable and maintainable over the due course of time.\r\n\r\nBut this polyglot environment presents a new challenge of installing, learning and maintaining programs in different programming languages and platforms, and combining them repeatedly to produce the desired results in analytics. Any slight change would require multiple changes to infrastructure and programs, which will cause delays to business in getting the insights that they expected, rendering Data Science projects in-effective.\r\n\r\n### How does Rebataur solves this.\r\nWe already know how powerful SQL is in managing data, and all big data platforms including Hadoop and Spark and even NoSQL ( from No SQL to Not Only SQL ) are converging in on SQL as a preferred data management tool.\r\n\r\nSo imagine you could write a SQL query that would abstract away the creation of different infrastructure like Hadoop/Spark/R etc in the background, and do so, on demand or on a schedule, pipeline and apply their algorithm along with your corporate data and finally output the results as a standard SQL query result.\r\n\r\nImagine you could query Twitter, Facebook for social metrics using SQL and enrich your reports, insights with Social sentiment analysis of your products or services, brands or offers.\r\n\r\nRebataur project is trying to create a single SQL interface to all data science platform and programming languages, and all internet and social services,  so that you could just issue SQL statements and infrastructure and data pipeline would be created for you, and you would get the results without installing, maintaining or scaling these individual infrastructure in you data center or cloud.\r\n\r\nYou would be also be able to write plugins in case Rebataur lacks certain functionality that is critical to you.\r\n\r\nAttribution : Postgresql , Multicorn, Python, Hadoop, Hive, CSVKIT, pyhs2\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more info please email on - info at rebataur dot com\r\n","google":"UA-65579198-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
